# custom-portals
Portals using Angular JS framework with PHP

The portals I created are standalone framework designed to suit the customer's company workflow for internal/private/members use only.

The user credentials will be using the exisiting platforms that is used to manage the website such as Wordpress for example. If there is none, a custom user management will be provided. Almost every portals I have created already has an admin panel with all management tools, each tool is designed for specific event and can be modified at any time.

Example of Portal usages are:
managing shop orders beyond the capabilities of existing e-commerce storefront websites such as shopifly or woocommerce, for example we have drivers and deliveies at a specific time slot at a fixed intervals, we will want to be able to track and monitor how the packers packs the order, we have custom idiciators such as large order, first timer, top 100 buyers, priors, scam prevention tools, daily log lookups, editing orders with detail screen view, color coded items for easy packing, so forth. Most of the functions are designed for workflow automation and assurance.
